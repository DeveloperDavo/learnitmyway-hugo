After applying my tips on [networking](https://learnitmyway.com/2017/01/31/how-to-network-as-a-software-developer/), it was time to apply for a job. In this article, I would like to share my tips on writing a CV. Since so many of you have asked, here is [my CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3ZNcIeUNLoLbHpZNU5JWWhQM0E/view) that led to a job offer!

### Tip 1: Showcase your tech stack

The easiest way to do this is to list the stack under a previous project that you have worked on. Another way is to showcase your projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/learnitmyway). I also included a section in my CV called “self study” where I listed courses, books and podcasts that I have used to [teach myself about software development](https://learnitmyway.com/learning-material-software-development/). Keep in mind I didn’t include the whole list, only those that I thought were necessary for the position I was applying for.

### Tip 2: Use Action verbs to demonstrate your experience

Examples include: “applied”, “improved”, “implemented” (Imperial College in London has a [more extensive list](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/staff/educational-development/teaching-toolkit/intended-learning-outcomes/choosing-action-verbs/)). An example of what was in my CV from the end of 2016 is: “Ensured quality with unit and integration tests and applying [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)”.

### Tip 3: Tailor your CV to the position you are applying for

This means your CV might differ for each job application you have! I like to proofread my CV (many times) and only focus on weeding out what isn’t necessary for each job I am applying for. As an example, I recently applied for a job that mentioned [clean code](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Code) in the job ad so under a section called “self study” I included [Clean Code by Robert Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code).

### Tip 4: Include your interests

This will give you something to talk about during the interview and it is your chance to show a bit of personality. Be specific if you can. For example, in my CV I have “reading fantasy and non-fiction”. I actually recently got asked at different interviews, which book I was reading. (For those of you who are interested, I was reading [Morning Star](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18966806-morning-star?from_search=true) at the time and it was awesome!)
