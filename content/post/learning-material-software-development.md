In this article, I share the learning resources that I have used to teach myself software development since early 2015. I cover fundamentals, Java, SQL, JavaScript, React, Docker, Rails, Android, iOS, best practices, Vim and more.

## Starting with the fundamentals

Having a strong understanding of the fundamentals is extremely important when learning something new. The following course blew away my expectations and is part of the reason [why I changed careers](https://learnitmyway.com/2016/08/10/why-i-changed-careers/) to developing software.

### [Introduction to Computer Science (CS50) - Harvard](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science)

This is where I started in early 2015 and I highly recommend it.

Mid 2019 I started to learning [data structures and algorithms with these resources](https://learnitmyway.com/learn-ds-algorithms/) in depth.

- **Type**: Online Course at edX
- **Length**: 100+ hours

There is no denying that CS50 is challenging, especially if you are completing it by yourself. I stopped and started at least once and completed all problem sets over the course of a year, but I was so glad that I stuck with it. If you would prefer to undertake something less gruelling I would recommend having a look at [Learn how to code with these resources](https://learnitmyway.com/2017/06/04/learn-how-to-code-with-these-resources/) for some alternatives.

## Experimenting with different technologies

### Java

By late 2015 I was starting to consider a career in software development and started [learning Java with these resources](https://www.learnitmyway.com/2017/07/02/learn-java-with-these-resources/).

I chose Java as my first language because it was one of the most popular programming languages at the time and seemed to offer a lot of job opportunities.

### SQL

In early 2016, I completed [Intro to SQL at Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql). The knowledge I acquired from this course has been very helpful in web and mobile development.

In early 2021, I completed [Learn SQL at Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql), which was a helpful refresher. 

### JavaScript

After getting some work experience developing software, I decided in early 2017 to start [learning Javascript with these resources](https://learnitmyway.com/learn-javascript-with-these-resources/) because of its ubiquity.

### React

I started [learning React with these resources](https://learnitmyway.com/learn-react-with-these-resources/) in early 2018 as I was lucky enough to need it for a project at work. It has grown to become the technology I am most familiar with.

### Firebase

I started [learning Firebase with these resources](http://learnitmyway.com/learn-firebase/) in late 2018 because I wanted to use it for a side project.

### Docker

I started [learning Docker with these resources](https://learnitmyway.com/learn-docker/) in mid 2018 because I was lucky enough to need it for a project at work.

### Ruby and Rails

During the holidays over the 2019-2020 break I decided to invest some time [learning Ruby and Rails with these resources](https://learnitmyway.com/learn-ruby-rails/). I found it to be more beginner-friendly than learning Java and Spring.

### Android

Before deciding to change careers in late 2015 I started [learning Android with these Resources](https://www.learnitmyway.com/2017/08/12/learn-android-with-these-resources/).

### iOS

After getting a taste of Android development, (mid 2016) I decided it would also be a good idea to [learn iOS with these Resources](https://www.learnitmyway.com/2017/10/03/learn-ios-with-these-resources/).

## Other important resources

I have included my recommendations on writing maintainable code, career tips and object orientated programming in [Valuable resources for every software developer](https://learnitmyway.com/resources-for-every-developer/).

### [HTTP & Web Servers - Udacity](https://udacity.com/course/http-web-servers--ud303)

Completing this course in late 2018 helped improve my understanding of cookies, HTTP(S) and how web servers work. I highly recommend it to anyone building web or mobile applications.

- **Type**: Online Course at edX
- **Length**: ~10hours
- **Assumed Knowledge**: Any Object Oriented language, basic knowledge of the terminal and HTML

## Nice to know

### [From Nand to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

A really interesting course on building a modern computer.

- **Type**: Online course at Coursera
- **Length**: ~20hours

### [Practical Vim - Drew Niel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13607232-practical-vim?from_search=true)

I use Vim as a text editor (also in IDEs) whenever I can. This book is a great resource to obtain in-depth knowledge about the language.

- **Type**: Textbook
- **Length**: 300 pages
- **Assumed Knowledge**: Vim tutorial (which can be accessed by typing `vimtutor` in a terminal)
